# Di치rio Oficial

**Di치rio Oficial** is the Brazilian government gazette, one of the best places to know the latest actions of the public administration, with distinct publications in the federal, state and municipal levels.

Even with recurrent efforts of enforcing the [Freedom of Information legislation](http://www.acessoainformacao.gov.br/assuntos/conheca-seu-direito/principais-aspectos/principais-aspectos) across the country, official communication remains - in most of the territories - in PDFs.

The goal of this project is to upgrade **Di치rio Oficial** to the digital age, centralizing information currently only available through separate sources.

When this project was initially released, had two distinct goals: creating crawlers for governments gazettes and parsing bidding exemptions from them. Now going forward, it is limited to the first objective.

## Development environment

The best way to understand how **Querido Di치rio** works, is getting the source
and run it locally. All crawlers are developed using [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org)
framework. They provide a [tutorial](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html)
so you can learn to use it.

If you are in a Windows computer, before you run the steps below you will need Microsoft Visual Build Tools (download [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/)). When you start the installation you need to select 'C++ build tools' on Workload tab and also 'Windows 10 SDK' and 'MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools' on Individual Components tab.

If you are in a Linux-like environment, the following commands will create a new
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) - that will keep
everything isolated from your system - activate it and install all libraries needed
to start running and developing new spiders.

```console
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r data_collection/requirements.txt
$ pre-commit install
```

In a Windows computer, you can use the code above. You just need to substitute ```source .venv/bin/activate ``` for ```.venv/Scripts/activate.bat```. The rest is the same as in Linux.

### Run Gazette Crawler

After configuring your environment, you will be able to execute and develop new spiders.
The Scrapy project is in `data_collection` directory, so you must enter in to execute the
spiders and the `scrapy` command: 

```console
$ cd data_collection
```

Following we list some helpful commands.

Get list of all available spiders:

```console
$ scrapy list
```

Execute spider with name `spider_name`:

```console
$ scrapy crawl spider_name
```

You can limit the gazettes you want to download passing `start_date` as argument with `YYYY-MM-DD` format. The
following command will download only gazettes which date is greater than 01/Sep/2020:

```console
$ scrapy crawl sc_florianopolis -a start_date=2020-09-01
```

## Troubleshooting

### `Python.h` missing

While running `pip install` command, you can get an error like below:

```
module.c:1:10: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory
     #include <Python.h>
              ^~~~~~~~~~
    compilation terminated.
    error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1
```

Please try to install `python3-dev`. E.g. via `apt install python3-dev`, if you
is using a Debian-like distro, or use your distro manager package. Make sure that
you use the correct version (e.g. `python3.6-dev` or `python3.7-dev`). You can
check your version via `python3 --version`.
